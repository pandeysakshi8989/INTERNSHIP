# Sentiment Analysis on Restaurant Reviews

## Overview
This project performs sentiment analysis on restaurant reviews using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques. The primary goal is to classify reviews into three sentiment categories: **positive**, **negative**, and **neutral**. This analysis helps restaurant owners and managers gain insights into customer feedback and improve their services.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: The programming language used for implementing the sentiment analysis.
- **NLTK**: Natural Language Toolkit, used for preprocessing the text data (tokenization, stop word removal, etc.).
- **Scikit-learn**: Used for training machine learning models like Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, and SVM.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and handling the dataset.
- **Matplotlib/Seaborn**: For visualizing data and results.
- **TextBlob**: For simple sentiment analysis based on predefined rules (optional).
- **TensorFlow/Keras**: (Optional) For deep learning-based sentiment analysis (if implemented).
  
## Installation
Follow the steps below to set up and run the project on your local machine.

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- pip (Python package installer)

### Install Required Libraries
To install the required libraries, run the following command in your terminal or command prompt:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

The `requirements.txt` file includes the following libraries:
```
pandas
numpy
nltk
scikit-learn
matplotlib
seaborn
textblob
tensorflow (optional for deep learning models)
```

### Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains restaurant reviews, which can be found in the file `restaurant_reviews.csv`. The dataset consists of the following columns:
- **Review**: Text of the customer review.
- **Sentiment**: The sentiment label for the review (`positive`, `negative`, `neutral`).

If you don't have the dataset, you can use any similar dataset, or you can modify the project to scrape reviews from online sources like Yelp, TripAdvisor, etc.

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/sentiment-analysis-restaurant-reviews.git
cd sentiment-analysis-restaurant-reviews
```

2. Run the main script to perform sentiment analysis:

```bash
python sentiment_analysis.py
```

3. The output will show the accuracy of the sentiment classification model and visualize sentiment distribution using Matplotlib/Seaborn.

## Project Structure
The project contains the following files:

- **`sentiment_analysis.py`**: The main script where sentiment analysis is performed. It includes text preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
- **`restaurant_reviews.csv`**: The dataset file containing the reviews and their sentiment labels.
- **`requirements.txt`**: A file listing the required Python libraries for the project.
- **`README.md`**: This file, providing an overview of the project.
- **`notebooks/`**: (Optional) Jupyter notebooks with additional analysis and model exploration (if used).

## Results
After running the model, the sentiment analysis will output:
- The **accuracy** of the sentiment classification model.
- **Confusion Matrix** showing how well the model classified the reviews into the three categories: positive, negative, and neutral.
- **Sentiment distribution** visualized with Matplotlib/Seaborn to show the proportion of each sentiment in the dataset.

## Example Usage
To test the sentiment analysis on a new review, you can use the following code snippet:

```python
from textblob import TextBlob

def predict_sentiment(review):
    # Use TextBlob to predict sentiment
    analysis = TextBlob(review)
    if analysis.sentiment.polarity > 0:
        return "positive"
    elif analysis.sentiment.polarity == 0:
        return "neutral"
    else:
        return "negative"

review = "The food was amazing, and the service was excellent!"
print(predict_sentiment(review))
```

## Future Enhancements
- **Aspect-based Sentiment Analysis**: Classifying reviews based on specific aspects such as food quality, service, ambiance, etc.
- **Multilingual Sentiment Analysis**: Expanding the project to handle reviews in multiple languages.
- **Deep Learning Models**: Implementing advanced models such as LSTMs, GRUs, or Transformer-based models like BERT for better performance.
- **Real-Time Sentiment Analysis**: Integrating the system with review platforms to analyze new reviews in real-time.
