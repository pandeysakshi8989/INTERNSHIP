How this works:
The function generate_monthly_graph reads the expenses from the file and groups them by month and category.
It uses matplotlib to generate a bar chart of expenses per category for a specific month (you can set the month dynamically if needed).
The bar chart will display categories on the x-axis and the total expenses for each category on the y-axis.
