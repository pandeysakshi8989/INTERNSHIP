Key Improvements:
Input Validation:

Check if the amount entered is a valid number using a try-except block to catch non-numeric input.
Check if all fields (date, category, and amount) are filled before adding an expense.
Error Handling:

Added try-except blocks around file operations (e.g., reading from or writing to expenses.txt) to catch and handle any issues.
If there is an error in file reading or writing, the program will show a message in the status label and print the error for debugging.
File Creation:

If the expenses.txt file doesn't exist, it is created. If there is an issue creating the file, it will raise an error with a message box indicating the problem.
Clear Status Messages:

The status label is used to indicate success or failure when adding or deleting an expense. It shows error messages in red and success messages in green.
Additional Notes:
Tkinter's messagebox: I added an error message box for critical errors like failing to create the expenses.txt file.
Expense Deletion: Deleting an expense is handled carefully by reading the file, updating it, and writing it back after removing the specific line.

Key Changes:
Date Validation:

We added a try-except block to check if the date entered is in the correct format (YYYY-MM-DD). If not, the program will show an error message.
Category Validation:

Ensured that the category field is not empty when adding an expense.
Expenses Grouped by Month:

In the view_expenses function, we introduced a dictionary expenses_by_month to group the expenses by month (e.g., "January 2025").
We use strftime("%B %Y") to get the month and year from the datetime object for grouping. Expenses are displayed in the order of the month (sorted by month).
Improved Data Display:

Expenses are displayed in the treeview, grouped by month.
Each expense is listed under the appropriate month in the treeview.

Key Changes:
Multiple Views:

Three new buttons are added to toggle between different views: "View All Expenses", "View Category Expenses", and "View Monthly Expenses".
Expenses Display Logic:

All Expenses: Displays all expenses with their dates, categories, and amounts.
Category-Wise Expenses: Groups expenses by category, displaying the total amount for each category.
Monthly Expenses: Groups expenses by month and year, displaying the total amount for each month.
Total Display: The total amount for each view is displayed at the bottom in the total_label.

File Handling: Ensures that expenses are saved and read from the expenses.txt file, and groups them based on the view selected.

Changes:
Date Format: The date input is now expected in the dd-mm-yyyy format. I used datetime.strptime(date, "%d-%m-%Y") to validate the format.
Expense Parsing: The datetime.strptime call now uses %d-%m-%Y to correctly parse dates in dd-mm-yyyy format.
File Handling and Date Parsing: When showing monthly expenses, Iâ€™ve changed the date parsing format to "%d-%m-%Y" to correctly handle the date input.

Changes:
Payment Mode:

Added a new input field (payment_mode_combobox) using a ttk.Combobox to select the payment mode (e.g., Cash, Credit Card, Debit Card, Online, etc.).
This value is saved to the expenses.txt file along with the other expense details.
Updated File Structure:

The format of each line in the expenses.txt file is now: date, category, amount, payment_mode.
Updated Table:

The table now displays a new column for the payment mode of each expense.
Expense Functions:

The add_expense and delete_expense functions have been updated to handle and store the payment mode.
The show_all_expenses, show_category_expenses, and show_monthly_expenses functions now also display the payment mode.

Key Changes:
Validation for the number of values in each line: While reading the file, each line is checked for having exactly 4 values (Date, Category, Amount, and Payment Mode). If a line contains fewer values, it is skipped.
This prevents the error where the program expects 4 values but gets 3.
